## What It Does ✨

**Auto Claude is a desktop app that supercharges your AI coding workflow.** Whether you're a vibe coder just getting started or an experienced developer, Auto Claude meets you where you are.

- **Autonomous Tasks** — Describe what you want to build, and agents handle planning, coding, and validation while you focus on other work
- **Agent Terminals** — Run Claude Code in up to 12 terminals with a clean layout, smart naming based on context, and one-click task context injection
- **Safe by Default** — All work happens in git worktrees, keeping your main branch undisturbed until you're ready to merge
- **Self-Validating** — Built-in QA agents check their own work before you review

**The result?** 10x your output while maintaining code quality.

## Key Features

- **Parallel Agents**: Run multiple builds simultaneously while you focus on other work
- **Context Engineering**: Agents understand your codebase structure before writing code
- **Self-Validating**: Built-in QA loop catches issues before you review
- **Isolated Workspaces**: All work happens in git worktrees — your code stays safe
- **Memory Layer**: Agents remember insights across sessions for smarter decisions
- **Cross-Platform**: Desktop app runs on Mac, Windows, and Linux
- **Any Project Type**: Build web apps, APIs, CLIs — works with any software project

## 🚀 Quick Start (Desktop UI)

The Desktop UI is the recommended way to use Auto Claude. It provides visual task management, real-time progress tracking, and a Kanban board interface.

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js 18+** - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
2. **Python 3.9+** - [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. **Docker Desktop** - Required for the Memory Layer
4. **Claude Code CLI** - `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
5. **Claude Subscription** - Requires [Claude Pro or Max](https://claude.ai/upgrade) for Claude Code access

---

### Installing Docker Desktop

Docker runs the FalkorDB database that powers Auto Claude's cross-session memory.

| Operating System | Download Link |
|------------------|---------------|
| **Mac (Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3/M4)** | [Download for Apple Chip](https://desktop.docker.com/mac/main/arm64/Docker.dmg) |
| **Mac (Intel)** | [Download for Intel Chip](https://desktop.docker.com/mac/main/amd64/Docker.dmg) |
| **Windows** | [Download for Windows](https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe) |
| **Linux** | [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/) |

> **Not sure which Mac?** Click the Apple menu (🍎) → "About This Mac". Look for "Chip" - M1/M2/M3/M4 = Apple Silicon, otherwise Intel.

**After installing:** Open Docker Desktop and wait for the whale icon (🐳) to appear in your menu bar/system tray.

> **Using the Desktop UI?** It automatically detects Docker status and offers one-click FalkorDB setup. No terminal commands needed!

📚 **For detailed installation steps, troubleshooting, and advanced configuration, see [guides/DOCKER-SETUP.md](guides/DOCKER-SETUP.md)**

### Step 1: Set Up the Python Backend

The Desktop UI runs Python scripts behind the scenes. Set up the Python environment:

```bash
cd auto-claude

# Using uv (recommended)
uv venv && uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or using standard Python
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Start the Memory Layer

The Auto Claude Memory Layer provides cross-session context retention using a graph database:

```bash
# Make sure Docker Desktop is running, then:
docker-compose up -d falkordb
```

### Step 3: Install and Launch the Desktop UI

```bash
cd auto-claude-ui

# Install dependencies (pnpm recommended, npm works too)
pnpm install
# or: npm install

# Build and start the application
pnpm run build && pnpm run start
# or: npm run build && npm run start
```

### Step 4: Start Building

1. Add your project in the UI
2. Create a new task describing what you want to build
3. Watch as Auto Claude creates a spec, plans, and implements your feature
4. Review changes and merge when satisfied

## 🎯 Features

### Kanban Board

Plan tasks and let AI handle the planning, coding, and validation — all in a visual interface. Track progress from "Planning" to "Done" while agents work autonomously.

### Agent Terminals

Spawn up to 12 AI-powered terminals for hands-on coding. Inject task context with a click, reference files from your project, and work rapidly across multiple sessions.

**Power users:** Connect multiple Claude Code subscriptions to run even more agents in parallel — perfect for teams or heavy workloads.

### Insights

Have a conversation about your project in a ChatGPT-style interface. Ask questions, get explanations, and explore your codebase through natural dialogue.

### Roadmap

Based on your target audience, AI anticipates and plans the most impactful features you should focus on. Prioritize what matters most to your users.

![Auto Claude Roadmap](.github/assets/Auto-Claude-roadmap.png)

### Ideation

Let AI help you create a project that shines. Rapidly understand your codebase and discover:
- Code improvements and refactoring opportunities
- Performance bottlenecks
- Security vulnerabilities
- Documentation gaps
- UI/UX enhancements
- Overall code quality issues

### Changelog

Write professional changelogs effortlessly. Generate release notes from completed Auto Claude tasks or integrate with GitHub to create masterclass changelogs automatically.

### Context

See exactly what Auto Claude understands about your project — the tech stack, file structure, patterns, and insights it uses to write better code.

## CLI Usage (Terminal-Only)

For terminal-based workflows, headless servers, or CI/CD integration, see **[guides/CLI-USAGE.md](guides/CLI-USAGE.md)**.

## ⚙️ How It Works

Auto Claude focuses on three core principles: **context engineering** (understanding your codebase before writing code), **good coding standards** (following best practices and patterns), and **validation logic** (ensuring code works before you see it).

### The Agent Pipeline

**Phase 1: Spec Creation** (3-8 phases based on complexity)

Before any code is written, agents gather context and create a detailed specification:

1. **Discovery** — Analyzes your project structure and tech stack
2. **Requirements** — Gathers what you want to build through interactive conversation
3. **Research** — Validates external integrations against real documentation
4. **Context Discovery** — Finds relevant files in your codebase
5. **Spec Writer** — Creates a comprehensive specification document
6. **Spec Critic** — Self-critiques using extended thinking to find issues early
7. **Planner** — Breaks work into subtasks with dependencies
8. **Validation** — Ensures all outputs are valid before proceeding

**Phase 2: Implementation**

With a validated spec, coding agents execute the plan:

1. **Planner Agent** — Creates subtask-based implementation plan
2. **Coder Agent** — Implements subtasks one-by-one with verification
3. **QA Reviewer** — Validates all acceptance criteria
4. **QA Fixer** — Fixes issues in a self-healing loop (up to 50 iterations)

Each session runs with a fresh context window. Progress is tracked via `implementation_plan.json` and Git commits.

### 🔒 Security Model

Three-layer defense keeps your code safe:
- **OS Sandbox** — Bash commands run in isolation
- **Filesystem Restrictions** — Operations limited to project directory
- **Command Allowlist** — Only approved commands based on your project's stack

### 🧠 Memory Layer

The Memory Layer is a **hybrid RAG system** combining graph nodes with semantic search to deliver the best possible context during AI coding. Agents remember insights from previous sessions, discovered codebase patterns persist and are reusable, and historical context helps agents make smarter decisions.

**Architecture:**
- **Backend**: FalkorDB (graph database) via Docker
- **Library**: Graphiti for knowledge graph operations
- **Providers**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, or Ollama (local/offline)

| Setup | LLM | Embeddings | Notes |
|-------|-----|------------|-------|
| **OpenAI** | OpenAI | OpenAI | Simplest - single API key |
| **Anthropic + Voyage** | Anthropic | Voyage AI | High quality |
| **Ollama** | Ollama | Ollama | Fully offline |
| **Azure** | Azure OpenAI | Azure OpenAI | Enterprise |
